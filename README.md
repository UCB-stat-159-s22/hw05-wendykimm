## Fine-tuning reproduciblity of LIGO Black Hole signal tutorial

** Add Binder badge and link here**

Hi Professor and Facu! While adding my Binder Badge to my hw06 repository, I accidentally edited and committed my hw05 repository instead. I would greatly appreciate it if my hw05 is not considered "late" because of the most recent commit because it was a quick mistake I resolved while working on hw06.
Thank you so much for your understanding!

**Note:** This repository is public so that Binder can find it. All code and data is based on the original [LIGO Center for Open Science Tutorial Repository](https://github.com/losc-tutorial/LOSC_Event_tutorial). This repository is a class exercise that restructures the original LIGO code for improved reproducibility, as a homework assignment for the [Spring 2022 installment of UC Berkeley's Stat 159/259 course, _Reproducible and Collaborative Data Science_](https://ucb-stat-159-s22.github.io). Authorship of the original analysis code rests with the LIGO collaboration.
